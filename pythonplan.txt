Computer Programming, Mr. Rai



 Overall Goal

On discord, there is a bot that allows users to add funny effects to their images.
 You can add filters, funny text, or adjust the saturation. I believe that this project is similar.
The overall goal of this script is to allow the creator to upload images and change certain things about it, similar to the discord bot. 
You will be able to use the module and apply everything provided. You can also change the format of the image; from JPEG to PNG. 
This script will only use the module, but the more advanced one gets at coding, the more they will realize they can upload and create 
their own effects with code and apply it the same way. 

Code Plan

Before I start coding, here is what I imagine is the plan:

- Import the module
- Add images you want to modify to a file so the script can access it 
- Start typing code
- Define functions first 
- Implement the functions
